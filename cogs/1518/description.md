<div class="ptx" lang="zh-CN">
Squares and rectangles fascinated the famous Dutch painter Piet Mondriaan. One night, after producing the drawings in his &#39;toilet series&#39; (where he had to use his toilet paper to draw on, for all of his paper was filled with squares and rectangles), he dreamt of filling a large rectangle with small rectangles of width 2 and height 1 in varying ways. <br/>

<br/>
Expert as he was in this material, he saw at a glance that he&#39;ll need a computer to calculate the number of ways to fill the large rectangle whose dimensions were integer values, as well. Help him, so that his dream won&#39;t turn into a nightmare!
