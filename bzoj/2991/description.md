<div class="content"><div>Have you ever gambled? I wish you not. Being a professional gambler for three years, I learned every</div>
<div> trick they play. Gambling is has nothing to do with luck. It is all about cheating.One of the most </div>
<div>elementary tricks is &#34;mercury dice&#34;. Instead of being solid, there is a hollow chamber, filled with </div>
<div>mercury, inside of the dice. This little modification makes the dice asymmetric, so that, the probab</div>
<div>ility of each outcome is not equal. Imprecisely, which face is up, depends on the previous state.To </div>
<div>simplify the model, we use &#34;mercury coin&#34; here. As we mentioned, the state (head or tail) after toss</div>
<div>ing depends on the state before. The probability of that the two states are same, is p. For example,</div>
<div> if the head side is up now, the probability that, the coin is still head up after tossing is p. And</div>
<div> the probability that the tail side come up is 1-p. If p=0.5, it is a common coin. When p≠ 0.5, thi</div>
<div>s coin is mercury coin. Assume the coin is head up now. After we toss Ntimes, what is the probabilit</div>
<div>y that, the number of heads is less than a certain number K?</div>

# Input

<div class="content"><div>The test file contains multiple lines, and each line is a test case. </div>
<div>Each test cases consists of three numbers</div>
<div>N K p</div>
<div>N and K are integers, and p is a float number. </div>
<div>N ≤ 30000</div>
<div>K ≤ N</div>
<div>0 ≤ p ≤ 1</div></div>

# Output

<div class="content"><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p><dt>
<div>For each test case, output the probability that, after tossing N times, the number of heads is less </div>
<div>than K. Rounded to the three digit after the decimal point.</div>
</dt>
