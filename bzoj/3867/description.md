<div class="content"><div>There is an old country and the king fell in love with a devil. The devil always asks the king to do some crazy things. Although the king used to be wise and beloved by his people. Now he is just like a boy in love and can’t refuse any request from the devil. Also, this devil is looking like a very cute Loli.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let us continue our story, z*p(actually you) defeat the &#39;MengMengDa&#39; party&#39;s leader, and the &#39;MengMengDa&#39; party dissolved. z*p becomes the most famous guy among the princess&#39;s knight party. </div>
<div></div>
<div>One day, the people in the party find that z*p has died. As what he has done in the past, people just say &#39;Oh, what a nice boat&#39; and don&#39;t care about why he died.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Since then, many people died but no one knows why and everyone is fine about that. Meanwhile, the devil sends her knight to challenge you with Algorithm contest.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is a hard data structure problem in the contest:</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are n numbers a_1,a_2,...,a_n on a line, everytime you can change every number in a segment [l,r] into a number x(type 1), or change every number a_i in a segment [l,r] which is bigger than x to gcd(a_i,x) (type 2).</div>
<div></div>
<div>You should output the final sequence.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Input

<div class="content"><div>The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.</div>
<div>For each test case, the first line contains a integers n.</div>
<div>The next line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n separated by a single space.</div>
<div>The next line contains an integer Q, denoting the number of the operations.</div>
<div>The next Q line contains 4 integers t,l,r,x. t denotes the operation type.</div>
<div></div>
<div>T&lt;=2,n,Q&lt;=100000</div>
<div>a_i,x &gt;=0</div>
<div>a_i,x is in the range of int32(C++)</div>
<p></p></div>

# Output

<div class="content"><div>
<div>For each test case, output a line with n integers separated by a single space representing the final sequence.</div>
<div>Please output a single more space after end of the sequence</div>
</div>
<p></p></div>
