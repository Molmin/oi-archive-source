# Description

<div class="content"><div>As we know, Rikka is poor at math. Yuta is worrying about this situation. He&#39;s given Rikka many math tasks to practice but she hasn&#39;t solved any of them. So, today he comes up with a simple problem to help her build up confidence:</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is a tree with m nodes, you can delete some of the nodes on the tree and there mustn&#39;t be any edges connecting two remained nodes. You need to maximize the number of the points remained.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rikka thinks this task is too simple, so she comes up with a new problem:</div>
<div></div>
<div>At first there is a tree with only one node. And then each time she links a new node to the tree. After each operation, you need to tell her the maximum number of the points remained (as described above).</div>
<div></div>
<div>This problem is too difficult for Rikka to solve. Can you help her?</div>
<p></p></div>

# Input

<div class="content"><div>There are no more than 100 testcases and there are no more than 3 testcases with n&gt;10^3. </div>
<div></div>
<div>For each testcase, the first line contains a number n (1≤n≤10^5).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Then n−1 lines follow. The ith line contains a single number fi (0≤fi&lt;i), which means that after the ith operation there is a new node numbered i and there is an edge between node i and node fi.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Output

<div class="content"><div>For each operation you need to print a single line with a single number - the answer after this operation.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Sample Input
