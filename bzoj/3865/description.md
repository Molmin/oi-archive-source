<div class="content"><div>There is an old country and the king fell in love with a devil. The devil always asks the king to do some crazy things. Although the king used to be wise and beloved by his people. Now he is just like a boy in love and can’t refuse any request from the devil. Also, this devil is looking like a very cute Loli.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you solved the last problem, you will see that the devil can&#39;t figure out who is z*p because there are too many people. So anyway, she decided to let it go.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The devil think she is the cutest loli in the world, but there is some people in the kingdom don&#39;t think so. And they think WJMZBMR is the most cutest loli. </div>
<div></div>
<div>It seems a war is approaching, but in this kingdom, due to the old tradition, every conflict is solved by Algorithm contest!</div>
<div></div>
<div>One day, WJMZBMR is hanging out with her friend s***kplus on the street. And she noticed that there is a group of people playing algorithm contest to decide who is the cutest loli in the kingdom. One problem attracts her interest:</div>
<div></div>
<div>Given a tree with n vertices, we randomly choose k vertices of it. Then we can induced a subtree which is the smallest connected subtree of the original tree containing those k vertices.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Each vertex has a label(an integer), for a subtree we induced, we look at its diameter a-b,(if there are many diameters, pick the one with the smallest a, and then the smallest b). And output how many distinct label are on the diameter.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What is the expected value we output?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course, WJMZBMR is merely a cute loli and don&#39;t know much about the algorithm contest, but since you are a member of Princess&#39;s Knight, you should solve it for your princess, can you do it?</div>
<p></p></div>

# Input

<div class="content"><div>The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.</div>
<div>For each test case, the first line contains two integers n,k.</div>
<div>The next n-1 lines, each contains two integers a and b, denote there is an edge between a and b.</div>
<div>The next line contains n integers separated by a single space, denote each vertex&#39;s label in the order from 1 to n.</div>
<div></div>
<div>n,k &lt;= 300. label &lt;= 10^9.</div>
<div>T &lt;= 20.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Output

<div class="content"><div>For each case, output the result.</div>
