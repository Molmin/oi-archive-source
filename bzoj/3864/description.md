<div class="content"><div>There is an old country and the king fell in love with a devil. The devil always asks the king to do some crazy things. Although the king used to be wise and beloved by his people. Now he is just like a boy in love and canâ€™t refuse any request from the devil. Also, this devil is looking like a very cute Loli.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After the ring has been destroyed, the devil doesn&#39;t feel angry, and she is attracted by z*p&#39;s wisdom and handsomeness. So she wants to find z*p out.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But what she only knows is one part of z*p&#39;s DNA sequence S leaving on the broken ring.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let us denote one man&#39;s DNA sequence as a string consist of letters from ACGT. The similarity of two string S and T is the maximum common subsequence of them, denote by LCS(S,T).</div>
<div></div>
<div>After some days, the devil finds that. The kingdom&#39;s people&#39;s DNA sequence is pairwise different, and each is of length m. And there are 4^m people in the kingdom.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Then the devil wants to know, for each 0 &lt;= i &lt;= |S|, how many people in this kingdom having DNA sequence T such that LCS(S,T) = i.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You only to tell her the result modulo 10^9+7.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Input

<div class="content"><div>The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.</div>
<div>For each test case, the first line contains a string S. the second line contains an integer m.</div>
<div></div>
<div>T&lt;=5</div>
<div>|S|&lt;=15. m&lt;= 1000.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Output

<div class="content"><div>For each case, output the results for i=0,1,...,|S|, each on a single line.</div>
<p></p></div>
