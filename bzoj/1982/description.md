<div class="content">2021. Moving Pebbles
Two players play the following game. At the beginning of the game they start with n (1&lt;=n&lt;=100000) piles of stones. At each step of the game, the player chooses a pile and remove at least one stone from this pile and move zero or more stones from this pile to any other pile that still has stones. A player loses if he has no more possible moves. Given the initial piles, determine who wins: the first player, or the second player, if both play perfectly. 


给你N堆Stone，两个人玩游戏.
每次任选一堆，首先拿掉至少一个石头,然后移动任意个石子到任意堆中.
谁不能移动了，谁就输了...
