<div>z*p&#39;s wisdom and handsomeness. So she wants to find z*p out.But what she only knows is one part of</div>
<div>z*p&#39;s DNA sequence S leaving on the broken ring.Let us denote one man&#39;s DNA sequence as a string</div>
<div>consist of letters from ACGT. The similarity of two string S and T is the maximum common subsequence</div>
<div>of  them, denote by LCS(S,T).After some days, the devil finds that. The kingdom&#39;s people&#39;s DNA sequence</div>
<div>is pairwise different, and each is of length m. And there are 4^m people in the kingdom.Then the dev</div>
<div>il wants to know, for each 0 &lt;= i &lt;= |S|, how many people in this kingdom having DNA sequence T such</div>
<div>that LCS(S,T) = i.You only to tell her the result modulo 10^9+7.</div>
<div></div>

# Input

<div class="content"><div>The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.</div>
<div>For each test case, the first line contains a string S. the second line contains an integer m.</div>
<div>T&lt;=5</div>
<div>|S|&lt;=15. m&lt;= 1000.</div>
<div></div>
<p></p></div>

# Output

<div class="content"><div>For each case, output the results for i=0,1,...,|S|, each on a single line.</div>
