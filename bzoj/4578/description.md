# Description

<div class="content"><div>Farmer John&#39;s N cows (3≤N≤50,000) are all located at distinct positions in his two-dimensional fie</div>
<div>ld. FJ wants to enclose all of the cows with a rectangular fence whose sides are parallel to the x a</div>
<div>nd y axes, and he wants this fence to be as small as possible so that it contains everycow (cows on </div>
<div>the boundary are allowed).FJ is unfortunately on a tight budget due to low milk production last quar</div>
<div>ter. He would therefore like to enclose a smaller area to reduce maintenance costs, and the only way</div>
<div> he can see to do this is by building two enclosures instead of one. Please help him compute how muc</div>
<div>h less area he needs to enclose, in total, by using two enclosures instead of one. Like the original</div>
<div> enclosure, the two enclosures must collectively contain all the cows (with cows on boundaries allow</div>
<div>ed), and they must have sides parallel to the x and y axes. The two enclosures are notallowed to ove</div>
<div>rlap -- not even on their boundaries. Note that enclosures of zero area are legal, for example if an</div>
<div> enclosure has zero width and/or zero height.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Input

<div class="content"><p>The first line of input contains N. The nextNN lines each contain two integers specifying the location of a cow. Cow locations are positive integers in the range 1…1,000,000,000</p>
<p></p></div>

# Output

<div class="content"><div>Write a single integer specifying amount of total area FJ can save by using two enclosures instead o</div>
<div>f one.</div>
<p></p></div>
