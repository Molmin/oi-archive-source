<div class="content"><div>There is an old country and the king fell in love with a devil. The devil always asks the king to do some crazy things. Although the king used to be wise and beloved by his people. Now he is just like a boy in love and canâ€™t refuse any request from the devil. Also, this devil is looking like a very cute Loli.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You may wonder why this country has such an interesting tradition? It has a very long story, but I won&#39;t tell you :).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let us continue, the party princess&#39;s knight win the algorithm contest. When the devil hears about that, she decided to take some action.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But before that, there is another party arose recently, the &#39;MengMengDa&#39; party, everyone in this party feel everything is &#39;MengMengDa&#39; and acts like a &#39;MengMengDa&#39; guy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>While they are very pleased about that, it brings many people in this kingdom troubles. So they decided to stop them.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Our hero z*p come again, actually he is very good at Algorithm contest, so he invites the leader of the &#39;MengMengda&#39; party xiaod*o to compete in an algorithm contest.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As z*p is both handsome and talkative, he has many girl friends to deal with, on the contest day, he find he has 3 dating to complete and have no time to compete, so he let you to solve the problems for him.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And the easiest problem in this contest is like that:</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is n number a_1,a_2,...,a_n on the line. You can choose two set S(a_s1,a_s2,..,a_sk) and T(a_t1,a_t2,...,a_tm). Each element in S should be at the left of every element in T.(si &lt; tj for all i,j). S and T shouldn&#39;t be empty.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And what we want is the bitwise XOR of each element in S is equal to the bitwise AND of each element in T.</div>
<div></div>
<div>How many ways are there to choose such two sets? You should output the result modulo 10^9+7.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Input

<div class="content"><div>The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.</div>
<div>For each test case, the first line contains a integers n.</div>
<div>The next line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n which are separated by a single space.</div>
<div></div>
<div>n&lt;=10^3, 0 &lt;= a_i &lt;1024, T&lt;=20.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Output

<div class="content"><div>For each test case, output the result in one line.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Sample Input

<div class="content"><span class="sampledata">2<br/>
3<br/>
1 2 3<br/>
4<br/>
1 2 3 3</span></div>

# Sample Output

<div class="content"><span class="sampledata">1 <br/>
4<br/>
